## Part of the OS-Climate Family of Projects

This project is part of the OS-Climate and FINOS projects.

### Python tool: osc-devops-reusable-workflows

This repository contains a number of reusable workflows. The purpose of these
is to provide small pieces of reusable functionality which may be helpful to
the OS-Climate community and other projects. Right now, the current focus is on
Python and the tooling around Python projects, since that is the language
currently used for the vast majority of our hosted repositories.

The repository contains some sample Python code which is published to the Python
package index repository and is installable with the Python "pip" command. The
dummy sample project ensures Python packages can be built, tested and published
using the supplied GitHub composite actions, reusable workflows, and workflows.

Relevant link to the Python package index installable:

[osc-devops-reusable-workflows](https://pypi.org/project/osc-devops-reusable-workflows)

Further detailed documentation will be supplied here once development is complete.
